# online-quiz-application

## Project Overview   
A full-stack Java web application built with Spring Boot, Spring MVC, JSP/JSTL, and Spring JDBC (JdbcTemplate) on MySQLâ€”intentionally avoiding JPA/Hibernate to use explicit SQL.  

##  What it does   
Users can register/login, browse quizzes by category, take timed quizzes, and view their scores/history. An admin console manages users, questions, and categories with CRUD, pagination, and basic moderation.
